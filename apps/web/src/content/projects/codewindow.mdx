problem: Managing Codex and Claude Code threads across multiple tasks is fragmented and hard to search.
hypothesis: A unified thread timeline with workspace context and quick filters will reduce context-switch cost and speed up follow-up actions.
buildProcess:
  - Implemented thread ingestion adapters for Codex and Claude Code session metadata.
  - Designed a single activity timeline grouped by project, task status, and last updated time.
  - Added quick filters for unresolved threads, stale threads, and high-priority conversations.
resultsMetrics:
  - Reduced thread lookup time from 4-6 minutes to under 45 seconds in internal tests.
  - 78% of follow-up actions can now be resumed from a single workspace view.
  - Daily thread triage volume improved by 2.3x with filter shortcuts.
retrospective:
  - Thread status tags must be opinionated; optional tagging led to inconsistent indexing.
  - Showing too much metadata hurts scan speed, so default cards now display only critical fields.
