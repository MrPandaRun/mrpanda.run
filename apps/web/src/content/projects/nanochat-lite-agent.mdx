problem: Many users want a minimal agent chat experience without heavy setup, long prompts, or complex orchestration.
hypothesis: A lightweight chat agent with compact memory, tool-call guardrails, and fast response loops is enough for most daily task workflows.
buildProcess:
  - Built a minimal chat shell with one model selector and one context pane.
  - Added lightweight memory summarization to keep token usage predictable.
  - Introduced strict tool-call limits and fallback mode for safer long sessions.
resultsMetrics:
  - Median first-response time is 1.2 seconds in production-like tests.
  - Session completion rate reached 64% for tasks under 20 minutes.
  - Average token usage per session dropped by 31% after memory compaction.
retrospective:
  - Simpler UX improved completion; advanced controls were moved behind defaults.
  - Guardrails must be visible to users, otherwise failures feel random.

PocketAgent is intentionally small: fast chat, clear behavior, and enough agent capability for everyday execution tasks.
