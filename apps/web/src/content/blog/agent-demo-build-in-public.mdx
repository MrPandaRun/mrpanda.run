## Define the problem before selecting the stack

I used to start from framework choices and ended up rebuilding after two days.

Now I write one-page problem notes first: who is this for, in which scenario, and why it matters now.

The stack is implementation detail. Problem clarity is product boundary.

## One iteration, one hypothesis

For the first iteration, I tested only one thing: are users willing to delegate a concrete task to an agent?

So I shipped only one button and one result page.

Removing side features made feedback loops much faster.

## Retrospectives outlive launch-day metrics

Launch-day numbers fluctuate heavily.
Good retrospectives keep bringing qualified readers for weeks.

Publicly documenting failed assumptions attracts the right discussions and improves the next build faster.
