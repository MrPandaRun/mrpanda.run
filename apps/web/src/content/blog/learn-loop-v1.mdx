## Build the loop before building the big project

Most people do not get stuck because they are weak. They get stuck because their input is fragmented and never closes into action.

My weekly structure is simple: Monday for input, Wednesday for experiments, Friday for output.

When the loop stabilizes, projects grow naturally and momentum stops depending on motivation.

## The 45-minute structure

I use three timed blocks.

In the first 15 minutes, I read one topic and extract three keywords.
In the next 20 minutes, I run one tiny experiment, such as writing a prompt or changing one script.
In the final 10 minutes, I publish a reusable takeaway card.

The rule is strict scope. More information is not always more progress.

## Mistakes that wasted my time

I saved too much and reviewed too little.
I tried solving multiple problems in one session.
I had no clear done criteria.

Now my bar is clear: can this experiment be reused next week?
