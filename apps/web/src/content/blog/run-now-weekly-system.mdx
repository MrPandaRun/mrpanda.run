## Why Learn, Build, Share as the default triad

Most plans fail because they over-index one stage.
People either keep learning without shipping, or keep shipping without reflection.

I force a weekly triad: Learn, Build, Share.
It balances input, execution, and synthesis.

## One topic, different tracks

The programmer track emphasizes implementation.
The non-technical track emphasizes process and tooling.
The creator track emphasizes expression and packaging.

After track segmentation, users can immediately find actions that match their current ability.

## Feedback forms are the growth lever

Every week I collect two things: where users got stuck and what they want next.

Then I update the next issue based on frequency, not intuition.
Conversion improves when content maps to real execution constraints.
