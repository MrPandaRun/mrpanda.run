## Clear claims, transparent reasoning

Public writing usually fails in two ways.
One is attitude without evidence.
The other is information without judgment.

I use a three-part structure: current conclusion, evidence source, and strongest counterexample.

## Uncertainty is not weakness

AI changes fast.
The goal is not to be permanently right.
The goal is to be explicit about how you update.

At the end of each post, I write: if X happens, I will adjust to Y.
That keeps the idea honest and durable.

## Consistency beats occasional spikes

A fixed publishing rhythm lowers cognitive load.
People return when they know when to expect your update.

Long-term trust is built by reliability, not by occasional viral posts.
